Web Data Integration used php and mysql. 
From the beginning of data processing systems through the middle of the 80’s decade,
integration between systems was always a custom, platform-specific affair. A continual
reliance on information systems with key databases combined with an exponential growth of
data. Heterogeneous Data is data from any number of sources, largely unknown and
unlimited, and in many varying formats. Data integration can be defined as "the use of
common field definitions and codes across different parts of an organization". Data
integration is a set of processes used to extract or capture, restructure, move, and load or
publish data, in either operational or analytic data stores, in either real time or in batch mode.
Because of the operational and analytic nature of integrating data, the frequency and
throughput of the data have developed into different types of data integration architectural
patterns and technologies. Therefore, an investigation of the architectural types or “patterns”
of data integration have been shown in this report. Data integration can be classified in two
types direct access and data access via mediator. In this paper I tried to show different kinds
of data integration where we use an example database software “USHR system” for show up
the both kinds of data integration i.e direct access and mediator based data integration. Here
data integrations in the database software “USHR system” is explained with flowchart and
architectural diagram . Two different database is studentdb(db1) and bracias(db2) where we
applied the direct access method and data integration via mediator method for integrate data
individually. Then we get the resulted form “Faculty Salary Form after integrating db1 and db2”
by using the direct access method and “data migrated form” for data integration via mediator
method.
